### Sup folks, Jon aka sgtherbz 

I'm new to the world of Github, or shall I say the public side as Ive been using the platform for a number of years privately for work etc. I feel I've reached a point in my journey that I can start sharing some of my work with the communities out there that I've had the pleasure of learning from. 


- Currently I'm an active developer for a Fivem server that specialises in simulating reality as close as possible 
- I specialise in LUA but have become very familiar with js, css and html along the way, wth fivem being built on GTAV I have also dabbled with .meta files for handling and models etc  
- I taught myself through wanting to recreate a digital space to hang out with some friends, along the way I have created af fully working ecomony server that combined with the roleplay gamemode has become almost an MMO/Metaverse were people can Escape the real world and imagination is your only boundry 
Releases
- Colaborating with other developers has always been an exceptional way of learning so I'm open for project ideas to go back and forth 
- The server i currently develop for uses a customised framework based off the original Table-Core aka QBUS framework so a lot of similarities with the latest qb-core framework and scripts can easily be adapted before release

I will be uploading more work throughout the year so keep an eye on my repositories
